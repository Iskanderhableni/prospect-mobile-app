# prospect-mobile-app
Designing and developing a prospecting mobile application.

Developed a mobile app that streamlines sales pipeline management for companies
by providing a centralized platform for company representatives to manage their
prospect tasks, including scheduling presentations, managing sales pitches, and
tracking customer interactions. The app improves the organization and management
of customer data, making it easier for representatives to systematically convert
potential customers into current customers.
The app was built using Flutter, a cross-platform mobile app development
framework, and leverages the GetX dependency for efficient state management. The
app communicates with a RESTful API built with Laravel, using the HTTP package for
seamless data exchange. Laravel Sanctum was used for API authentication, ensuring
the security of the app's data.
